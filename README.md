All Scripts and notebooks relating to the work done on cichlid data

1) CellTypist notebook helps me in predicting cell types on data generated recently. The model is trained on an anndata object which is similar to the object that the user wants to predict on.
2) SCCODA notebook helps in exploring the proportions within cell types and samples for a dataset.
